  <h2>About Me</h2>
 
    <p>
  Hello, I am Aastha, a Computer Science Engineering student passionate about coding, technology, and learning new things. This is an introduction to my portfolio.
  <span id="moreContent" style="display: none;">
    I enjoy solving complex problems and am constantly exploring new areas in software development, artificial intelligence, and web development.</p>
  <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have been involved in various coding challenges, which have significantly enhanced my problem-solving skills. I believe in lifelong learning and continually seek opportunities to expand my knowledge by attending online courses, and collaborating with others in the tech community.</p>
  <p>In addition to my technical skills, I also have a strong interest in design and user experience, which I believe plays a crucial role in making technology accessible and enjoyable for everyone. I strive to build applications that are not only functional but also intuitive and easy to use.</p>
  <p>I am always excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore innovative ways to solve real-world problems through technology.
